<h2 id="graph-as-adjacency-matrix">Graph as adjacency matrix</h2>
<p>We can construct an adjacency matrix to see which vertices are adjacent. Intersections in the matrix may be assigned 0 or 1 (true of false) for unweighted graphs or have other values if weighted.</p>
<p>An adjacency matrix can be constructed using a multi-dimensional array or parallel lists. An algorithms with a nested loop allows iteration over all possible vertex pairs.</p>
<p>The following pseudo code counts the number of edges for an undirected adjacent matrix:</p>
<pre><code>for i 0 to n :
  for j 0 to m :
    if pair[i][j] != pair[j][i] :
    count = count + 1
</code></pre>
<p>Since the adjacency matrix is symmetric about the diagonal, neither the diagonal nor values above the diagonal are counted. Hence, for an undirected adjacent matrix,</p>
<p>total number of possible edges = n * (n - 1) / 2</p>
<p>For a directed graph, entries are only made in the adjacency matrix if direction to a vertex exists. For example, consider the following adjacency matrix for the directed graph on the right. As you can see, the pair (1, 2) has and entry of 0 while the pair (2, 1) has an entry of 1. Because of the direction from vertex 1 to vertex 2, vertex 2 is adjacent to vertex 1 and vertex 1 is not adjacent to vertex 2.</p>

<p>The total possible edges for this graph is: 8 * (8 â€“ 1) / 2 == 56 / 2 == 28. However, the directional edges indicate just 10 neighbors. Stated differently, the connections of a directed graph have a head and a tail, whereby only the heads are counted.</p>
