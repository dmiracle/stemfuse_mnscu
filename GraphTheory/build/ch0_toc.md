# Module: Graph Theory â€“ 1 Credit / 15 hours

Competency: Mathematical Reasoning of Data 

Author: Jack Pope 

## Instructor Overview and Objective

This course module is about Graph Theory. 

Given that this module is to be worth 1 credit, or 15 hours of
coursework, the instructor should prepare three to five subtopic
discussions. These should account for at least 5 hours of instructional
material and might be in the form of lecture notes or lecture videos.
The additional hours should be comprised of student labs or assignments.
 

Traditionally, a course in Information Theory takes a theoretical
approach, on paper. However, the field of Data Science is an empirical
endeavor that programmatically emphasizes empirical evidence. 

Axioms which we accept as true are what support logical proof. Evidence
(data) supports empirical proof, certainty based on a measurement and
its statistical significance. A weakness of logical proof occurs when
erroneous accepted "facts" support an axiom. A weakness of the empirical
proof occurs when the data sample does not represent a population.

To accommodate our purposes, we will use the Python programming
language. The choice of programming language is ultimately left to the
instructor.
