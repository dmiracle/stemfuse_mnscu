<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Quantitative variables are variables taking numbers as values, such as weight, height, age, and etc. Quantitative variables are also called numeric variables. Most commonly used graph for showing the relationship between two quantitative variables is scatter plot. Other commonly used graphs for showing characteristics of a quantitative variable are sunflower plot, correlation plot, box plot, line chart, histogram and bag plot. In this module, we will introduce different R functions for plotting quantitative variables.</p>
<p>To summarize, we need to choose appropriate graphs for a given data. A summary of graph selection is included in the PDF file of <em>Graph Selection Matrix</em> on D2l.</p>
